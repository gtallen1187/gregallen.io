# Chrome Extensions

Below is a list of Chrome extensions that I've found helpful, useful, or fun.  I've split them into two categories: [General Chrome extensions](#general) that are helpful for any user, and [Developer Chrome extensions](#developer) that are helpful specifically for tasks related to software development.  There's a [subsection for general](#from-google-general) and [another for developer](#from-google-developer) for extensions that are made by Google.
