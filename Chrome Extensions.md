# Opera Extensions

For those of you interested in the wide world of browsers beyond just Chrome, Firefox, and a couple others (there's one crappy one that comes complimentary with your iPhone purchase, and another crappy one that you have to use if you work at a company with >10,000 people), you should give Opera a try.  It works very well, and there's some interesting feature choices that are pretty cool.  Just like Chrome and Firefox, there's the standard Opera browser, as well as a Developer Preview version of Opera, so there's plenty to explore.

Regardless, if you do start playing around with Opera, make [installing this opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) the very first thing you do.  This extension makes it possible to use ***any Chrome browser extension with Opera***.  So if you're looking at the list of Opera browser extensions and wondering why there's no second page of results, this is your answer.
